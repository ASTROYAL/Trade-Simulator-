# Quantitative Trading Project

This project appears to be a quantitative trading application that combines data analysis, machine learning, and real-time market data processing capabilities.

## Project Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:

- **websockets (11.0.3)**: For real-time WebSocket communication, likely used for streaming market data
- **numpy (1.24.3)**: For numerical computations and array operations
- **pandas (2.0.3)**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **PyQt6 (6.5.2)**: For building the graphical user interface
- **scikit-learn (1.3.0)**: For implementing machine learning algorithms
- **python-dotenv (1.0.0)**: For managing environment variables and configuration
- **aiohttp (3.8.5)**: For asynchronous HTTP client/server functionality
- **asyncio (3.4.3)**: For writing concurrent code using async/await syntax
- **logging (0.5.1.2)**: For application logging and debugging

## Installation
